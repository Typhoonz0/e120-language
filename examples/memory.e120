$ test2.e ported to e120
$ tests stack memory 
$ e120 does not have a string stack - since the string stack was only added to e because i was bored

start
    out "Memory Test \n"
    stacksize 10
    push 256
    push 128
    push 64
    out "Available memory: "
    stacklen
    out "Raw contents: \n"
    fullstack
    clear
    stacksize 3
    push 1
    push 2
    push 3
    out "Available memory: "
    stacklen
    out "Raw contents: \n"
    fullstack
stop
